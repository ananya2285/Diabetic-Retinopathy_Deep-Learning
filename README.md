# Diabetic-Retinopathy_Deep-Learning

## Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and potentially dangerous consequence of diabetes mellitus. For immediate action and improved outcomes for patients, diabetic retinopathy must be identified early and properly classified. This calls for the creation of an automated deep learning-based system capable of precisely identifying and evaluating diabetic retinopathy in retinal pictures. 

The main goal of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a robust deep learning model for efficient and accurate diabetic retinopathy detection.
